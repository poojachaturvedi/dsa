A subarray is beautiful if the xor of the whole subrray becomes zero


arr : 4 1 1 2 2 3 3
res: 
intially i stands at 4
then it goes to xor then it gives 5
then do xor with 1 gives 5
the 1 -- 4
then 2 --6
then 2--4 
then 3--7
then 3--4

the resultant xor as 4  if any result is repeated it means some part of the subarray is giving us zero that's what we are getting
it signifies that that whole subarray part before it is zero 
we can just take the freq whenever freq of any element>1 then we will sum all the freq-1
we need to map the subarray and map the frequency


there are freq-1 beautiful subarray


EXPLANATION 2:
we need to choose two indexes in an array i and j
if kth bit of nums[i] and nums[j] is 1 then we need to subtract 2^k or we need to make it zero
make first bit which is set to zero
a subarray all element can become zero in the 


we have to make the set bit as zero
if we want to make the set bit as zero we can do the xor operation to make the bit as zero


[4,3,1,2,4]
[100,011,001,010,100]
the xor of all the elements is the zero here


find a subarray whose xor in range is zero
we need to find the ranges ehich has xor as zero
here we will apply the prefix xor


prefix xor
0^rest of the element




find prefix_xor
if prefix
