LINKED LIST

applying merge sort or bubble sort on ll

LIMITATIONS OF ARRAYS:
--array are continuous in memory or there is a FIXED SIZE we can't add it.Even using vector we can add element but it's gonna double the size even though it's amortized one still its not good

LINKED LIST
--LL doesn't have seperate location
--try to break indivual elements into boxes
--we are putting boxes at random spaces in the heap
--we can then link them via pointers
--it's mo longer in the continuous memory now


INTERNAL WORKING OF LINKED LIST:
--every single item knows about the next item
--a pointer called head that points to very first node
--tail is a pointer pointing to the last 

COMPONENTS OF A LINKED LIST
--every single box contain two components:
class Node{
int val	//valus in each node
Node* next	//next node being pointed by it
}

PROBLEM WITH LINKED LIST:
--no idea about total element
--to access third node run the for loop four times and so on
