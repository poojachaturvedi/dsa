PATTERNS REQUIRED:
--to perform anything first draw it 
--why head is not moving? --because changing the head changes the entire structure of the linked list but temp or temporary pointer is not
--if we are changing head we are basically changing the structure
--node.something=something    //changing something
--if two or more pointers are pointing to same object and we change it we are actually changing the object
--why can't we move backward?--we are not maintaining no variable pointing behind 
--any particular node is itself a ds 
--why next is of Node type? because there are no indexes involved in this process
--what is next?
