Topo sorts are only applicable on a DAG
But if the graph has a cycle 
Topo sort not possible for graph having cycle
Intially find the indegree of all the nodes
get the first node and put it in the queue 
if we produce a topo sort that is having element less than number of nodes then we can say that it contains a cycle
