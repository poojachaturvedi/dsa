Topological sorting
--exists on DAG directed acyclic graph
--linear ordering og vertices such that id there is an edge between u and v, u appears before v in that ordering

--any linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u and v , u always appear before v

5 4 2 3 1 0
4 5 2 3 1 0


there can be multiple linear ordering


why in DAG only?
because in undirected we mean that if u is to v so is v to u
why acylic ?
if there is a cycle then there can't be any linear ordering or there is a cyclic dependancy


declare a visited array and make sure everything is marked as zero intially
start dfs call from the zero and mark it as visited
stack 
if there is no neighbour or in case they are visited no further calls  and push it in stack
take out the element one by one this is one of the linear orderings that we can get this is what we call topological sort

time commplexity: o(v+e) for directed graph in the worst case


Intuition:
the nodes whose dfs is complete is pushed in the stack
